# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Developers and PMs can see tasks, MRs, sprint state, and notifications in one place without switching between Jira and GitLab.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-10 — Roadmap created from requirements + research

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Architecture: Tauri 2 portable build (no installer) — eliminates CORS against on-premise Jira; OS keychain for PATs via Tauri Stronghold; required before any feature code
- Auth: PAT-only (no OAuth) — tokens stored in OS keychain, never plaintext; 401 must surface re-auth banner not generic error
- Polling: Single poll coordinator, minimum 60s background / 30s notification-critical, cursor-based incremental fetches — must be established in Phase 2 before notification work
- Jira API: Server REST v2 only (not Cloud) — use `name` not `accountId`, offset pagination, per-issue transitions, Bearer PAT auth — validate with GET /rest/api/2/myself on real instance
- [Phase 01-foundation]: createHashRouter (not createBrowserRouter) for Tauri SPA routing — BrowserRouter breaks production builds
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Stronghold vault password: random 32-byte hex key on first launch stored in Tauri Store — migration path is replacing stronghold.ts with tauri-plugin-keyring in Tauri v3
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Single tauriService abstraction boundary for @tauri-apps/api/core — enables testing without Tauri runtime; only tauri.ts imports from there

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Tauri Stronghold v2 plugin API exact initialization pattern needs live verification against current Tauri 2 + Stronghold v2 docs (MEDIUM confidence on plugin details)
- Phase 2: Must validate Jira Server auth header format (Bearer vs Basic) against actual on-premise instance before writing axios interceptor
- Phase 2: GitLab self-hosted rate limit may differ from GitLab.com 2000 req/min — validate before setting polling intervals
- Phase 2: Gather 20+ real MR titles from team GitLab history before writing ticket-key regex (silent linking failures destroy trust)
