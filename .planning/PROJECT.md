# Taskflow

## What This Is

Taskflow is a cross-platform Tauri 2 desktop app for Orange's eshop development team. It unifies Jira (on-premise) and GitLab into a single fast, focused interface — replacing the need to juggle multiple slow tools. It ships as a portable executable (no installer, no admin rights), stores credentials in the OS keychain, and serves both developers and project managers with role-specific dashboards, automatic task-to-MR linking, a unified notifications hub, and global search.

## Core Value

Developers and PMs can see everything they need — tasks, merge requests, sprint state, and notifications — in one place, without switching between Jira and GitLab.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ PAT-based onboarding: Jira and GitLab credentials stored in OS keychain — v1.0
- ✓ Role selection (Developer / Project Manager) with settings change — v1.0
- ✓ Developer dashboard: My Tasks (current sprint), Sprint Board (columns by status), MR Attention list — v1.0
- ✓ Automatic task-to-MR linking via Jira ticket key in MR titles and commit messages — v1.0
- ✓ MR review health badges (waiting / approved / changes requested) on sprint board cards — v1.0
- ✓ Stale MR flagging with configurable threshold — v1.0
- ✓ Jira write actions: status transitions (optimistic update + rollback), inline comments — v1.0
- ✓ Unified notifications hub: Jira mentions + GitLab MR thread activity, delta polling — v1.0
- ✓ OS desktop notifications (macOS, Windows, Linux) with permission-denied in-app banner — v1.0
- ✓ In-app unread badge with mark-as-read and mark-all-read — v1.0
- ✓ PM dashboard: sprint progress (status buckets + story points), team workload, releases view — v1.0
- ✓ Releases view: Jira fix versions with date-matched GitLab milestones/tags — v1.0
- ✓ Global search across Jira tasks and GitLab MRs, grouped results with detail panel — v1.0
- ✓ Dark/light/system theme toggle with persistence — v1.0
- ✓ Last-refreshed timestamps and loading/error states on all data views — v1.0

### Active

*(None — v2.0 requirements to be defined via `/gsd:new-milestone`)*

### Out of Scope

- Historical analytics / burndown charts — no daily-use value; complex data pipeline; LinearB/Swarmia exist for this
- OAuth / SSO login — team uses PATs; OAuth adds server-side requirements conflicting with no-server architecture
- Multi-project aggregation — exponentially increases data model complexity; one project sufficient
- Create Jira task from GitLab MR — workflow confusion; task creation always explicit
- Full Jira issue editor (custom fields, attachments) — on-prem Jira has wildly varied custom field configs
- Two-way sync / webhooks — requires server component to receive webhooks
- Email or Slack notifications — external service dependencies
- Inline MR diff / full code review UI — GitLab's UI is mature; deep-link for full review
- GitLab write actions (approve, comment, request changes) — deferred to v2.0
- Create new Jira task from app — deferred to v2.0

## Context

- **Shipped v1.0:** 2026-03-12 — 4 phases, 20 plans, ~11,017 lines TypeScript, 348 files
- **Tech stack:** Tauri 2, React 18, TypeScript, Zustand, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui, Tailwind v4, Vitest
- **Jira instance:** On-premise (Jira Data Center v10.3.15) — no built-in notifications, REST API v2 with Bearer PAT auth
- **GitLab:** Self-hosted or gitlab.com — personal access token
- **Team:** Orange eshop project — developers + project managers using the same app with role-based views
- **Scale:** One Jira project + one GitLab group at a time
- **Build:** Portable executable — no installer, no admin rights; `createHashRouter` for SPA routing in production

## Constraints

- **Auth:** Personal access tokens only — no OAuth, no server-side credential storage
- **Cross-platform:** macOS, Windows, Linux via Tauri 2 portable build
- **Jira API:** Jira Data Center REST API v2 — not Cloud APIs; `name` not `accountId`, offset pagination, Bearer PAT
- **No analytics:** Real-time/live only — no historical data processing
- **Distribution:** Portable executable only — no system installer, no UAC/admin elevation

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Tauri 2 desktop app (portable build) | No CORS with on-premise Jira; no admin rights needed; ~10MB; OS keychain for PATs | ✓ Good — CORS eliminated, keychain works on all platforms |
| PAT-based auth only | Simple, no server needed, matches team's current practice | ✓ Good — PATs stable and sufficient |
| Task-MR linking via ticket number parsing | No formal integration; MR titles/commits contain ticket IDs | ✓ Good — automatic linking works reliably |
| Role-based dashboards (dev vs PM) | Different needs, same data sources | ✓ Good — clean separation with shared data layer |
| createHashRouter (not createBrowserRouter) | BrowserRouter breaks Tauri production SPA routing | ✓ Good — hash routing works correctly in portable build |
| Stronghold vault password from Tauri Store | Random 32-byte hex key on first launch; migration path is plugin-keyring in Tauri v3 | ✓ Good — secure, no user friction |
| Single tauriService abstraction (tauri.ts) | Enables testing without Tauri runtime | ✓ Good — test isolation clean |
| tauri-plugin-http fetch in renderer | Plain fetch() causes CORS in Tauri 2 webview for on-premise instances | ✓ Good — CORS resolved; vi.stubGlobal pattern for tests |
| Single poll coordinator (TanStack Query) | No per-component polling; minimum 60s dashboard / 30s notification-critical | ✓ Good — no redundant fetches |
| readIds as string[] (not Set) in notifications store | Zustand JSON persist serializes Set as empty object, losing read state on restart | ✓ Good — persistence works |
| Tailwind v4 with @tailwindcss/vite only | No postcss.config.js or tailwind.config.js; v4 CSS pipeline is sole entry point | ✓ Good — build output correct |
| StatusPopover with optimistic update + rollback | Loading feedback and error recovery without toast/modal clutter | ✓ Good — per-row inline errors |
| fetchFixVersions returns (data.values ?? []) | Jira returns paginated envelope not bare array; defensive fallback | ✓ Good — Releases tab stable |
| adfToPlainText handles null/string/ADF defensively | Jira Server returns strings, Cloud returns ADF; cast to unknown at call site | ✓ Good — no runtime crashes |
